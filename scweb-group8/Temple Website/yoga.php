<h3>What is Yoga?</h3>
<hr>
<p>Derived from the Sanskrit word yuj, Yoga means union of the individual consciousness or soul with the Universal Consciousness or Spirit. Yoga is a 5000 year old Indian body of knowledge. 
Though many think of yoga only as a physical exercise where people twist, turn, stretch, and breathe in the most complex ways, these are actually only the most superficial aspect of this profound science of unfolding the 
infinite potentials of the human mind and soul.</p>

<p>The science of Yoga imbibe itself the complete essence of the Way of Life, including - Gyan Yoga or philosophy, Bhakti Yoga or path of devotional bliss, 
Karma Yoga or path of blissful action, and Raja Yoga or path of mind control. Raja Yoga is further divided into eight parts. At the heart of the Raja Yoga system, 
balancing and unifying these various approaches, is the practice of Yoga Asana.</p>

<h3>What is Meditation?</h3>
<hr>
<p>Meditation has been practiced for thousands of years. It is considered a type of mind-body complementary medicine.
 Meditation produces a deep state of relaxation and tranquil mind.</p>
<p>Meditation can be an effective form of stress reduction and has the potential to improve quality of life and decrease healthcare costs.
Meditation is effortless and leads to a state of 'thoughtless awareness' in which the excessive stress producing activity of the mind is nueutralised without reducing alertness and effectiveness.
Authentic medication enables one to focus on the present moment rather than dwell on the unchangeable past or undetermined future.</p>
