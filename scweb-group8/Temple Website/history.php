				On one hot evening in December of 1980, Hindu families were discussing, among many things, the need to build our own Mandir where we could worship, share our cultural heritage with others and pass on our traditions to the future generation. As the interest in the idea grew, the discussion became more and more intense and enthusiasm for such a project became an overflowing desire. Someone said that a thousand-mile journey must begin with a single step. Our journey began at that instant. A dream was born. Then, a need to transform this dream into reality. A few families met to take further steps. We needed to determine what it would take to build our own temple. 
				</p>
				<p>
				Following this meeting, a series of events took place. Great pains were taken to develop and frame our constitution. Articles of Incorporation were prepared and submitted to the government. We were happy to find that our temple would be recognized as a non-profit organization by both the province of Ontario and the Canada Revenue Agency. This recognition was a giant leap forward towards our noble cause. Now, more than ever, we needed the support of the Indian community as a whole. We needed some way of informing everyone of this noble cause. So, on 1980, the first Samachar was sent to everyone in our community announcing the need for everyone's help to make this project a wonderful reality. 
				</p>
				<p>
				The first puja was held at Hindu Mandir Windsor in 1983 and continue till today. As a Hindu community growing in Windsor and Essex County, we would like to build a new Mandir and Bhartiya Cultural Center. The community’s response was simply overwhelming. We received cash donations and pledges for Mandir. The monumental response from the community propelled us directly toward our goal. What had started as the dream of a few people had now blossomed into the goal of an entire community. Now began the long and taxing search for a suitable site for which to build our temple. To ensure some sort of financial security for the purchase of the land, many fund raising dinners and functions were held. They were resounding successes.

				Finally, on February 2007, a 3.8-acre tract of land located in 7007 Enterprise way, Luzon Park an area of Windsor City was purchased. This purchase was a milestone in the history of the Hindu Mandir and Bhartiya Cultural Center of Windsor City. Never before had we purchased anything of such magnitude. It was another step closer to this noble goal. With great spirituality and festivity, the groundbreaking and bhumi puja would take place on August 2007 & April 4 2015. This day marked a new chapter in the history of our Mandir and Bhartiya Cultural Center. By now, we have to crossed many hurdles and were confident that our dream would soon become a reality. Much hard work had been accomplished but much more lay ahead. Our imaginations were let loose on conceptual ideas of the Mandir and Cultural Center. We had many designs, plans and ideas for it. Ultimately, though, it boiled down to the desires of the community versus financial constraints. We needed a place of worship and enlightenment with a functional, yet aesthetically pleasing design. Therefore, as soon as the Board of Directors approved the designs with the blessing of Pandit ji as a representative of God, construction began under the skilled supervision of Mr. Raz Brick by brick, the dream was beginning to take its shape. 
				</p>
				<p>
				Finally, the years of toil and hard work were starting to pay off. The Journey was at a landmark. The dream was almost alive. The construction of the Hindu Mandir and Cultural Center of Windsor City, on May 19 2015, would be a historic event. It would breathtaking achievement of incredible magnitude which has been tested the collective efforts of our community repeatedly, and it would here at begging. Now we have our own temple (November 2015), a place where we could gather, worship together and pass on our cultural heritage to our children. Much work would still to be done, but at last, the dream has been come true. At that time our efforts were concentrated on making our temple complete with devasthan and murtis. 
				</p>
				<p>
				In July of 2007, we have a dream, a dream of having our very own temple. In 2015, the Murti thapana would fulfill this dream; the temple building project passed many stages that tested the collective will, strength, and commitment of all those who were/would associated with it. Mandir’s successful completion and spiritual fulfillment is a source of satisfaction and pride for our entire community. There are so many people in our community who, in their own way, contributed toward the building fund. They are going to donate their time, efforts and labor. We offer our many sincere and heartfelt thanks. Your hard work would make it possible to realize this dream of our own Mandir. In future, we can pass on our heritage to future generations.
